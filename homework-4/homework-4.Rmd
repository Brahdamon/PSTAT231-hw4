## Resampling

For this assignment, we will continue working with part of a [Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) that was the subject of a machine learning competition and is often used for practicing ML models. The goal is classification; specifically, to predict which passengers would survive the [Titanic shipwreck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic).

Load the data from `data/titanic.csv` into *R* and familiarize yourself with the variables it contains using the codebook (`data/titanic_codebook.txt`).

Notice that `survived` and `pclass` should be changed to factors. When changing `survived` to a factor, you may want to reorder the factor so that *"Yes"* is the first level.

Make sure you load the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`!


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(rlang)
library(corrr)
library(klaR)
library(discrim)
library(poissonreg)

#library(ISLR) # For the Smarket data set
#library(ISLR2) # For the Bikeshare data set
tidymodels_prefer()

set.seed(22)

# Load Data
rawData <- read.csv("data/titanic.csv")
head(rawData)

# Copy dataframe
data <- duplicate(rawData, shallow = FALSE)

#reorder factors
data$survived <- factor(data$survived, levels = c("Yes", "No"))
data$pclass <- factor(data$pclass)
# data$sex <- factor(data$sex, levels = c("female", "male"))

levels(data$survived)
levels(data$pclass)

```

*Remember that you'll need to set a seed at the beginning of the document to reproduce your results.*

Create a recipe for this dataset **identical** to the recipe you used in Homework 3.


### Question 1

Split the data, stratifying on the outcome variable, `survived.`  You should choose the proportions to split the data into. Verify that the training and testing data sets have the appropriate number of observations. 

```{r}
titanicSplit <- initial_split(data, 
                              prop = 0.8, 
                              strata = survived)

dataTrain <- training(titanicSplit)
dataTest <- testing(titanicSplit)

titanicSplit

```

```{r}
names(dataTrain)


lm_spec <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  set_engine("lm")


# titanicPolyTunedRecipe <- recipe(survived ~ pclass +
#                            sex +
#                            age +
#                            sib_sp +
#                            parch +
#                            fare, data = dataTrain) %>%
#     step_impute_linear(age) %>%
#     step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
#     step_interact(terms = ~ sex_male:fare) %>%
#     step_interact(terms = ~ age:fare) %>%
#     step_poly(survived, degree = tune())


# poly_tuned_wf <- workflow() %>%
#   add_recipe(titanicPolyTunedRecipe) %>%
#   add_model(lm_spec)



# -------------------------# -------------------------# -------------------------


titanicRecipe <- recipe(survived ~ pclass + 
                           sex + 
                           age + 
                           sib_sp +  
                           parch +
                           fare, data = dataTrain) %>%
     step_impute_linear(age) %>%
     step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
     step_interact(terms = ~ starts_with("sex"):fare) %>%
     step_interact(terms = ~ age:fare)


titanicWkflw <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(lm_spec) %>%
  add_recipe(titanicRecipe)

```

```{r}
# fit(poly_tuned_wf, data = dataTrain)
#fit(titanicWkflw, data = dataTrain)
```

### Question 2

Fold the **training** data. Use *k*-fold cross-validation, with $k = 10$.

```{r}

# titanicPolyTunedRecipe <- titanicRecipe %>%
#   step_poly(survived, degree = tune())
# 
# poly_tuned_wf <- workflow() %>%
#   add_recipe(titanicPolyTunedRecipe) %>%
#   add_model(lm_spec)

titanicFolds <- vfold_cv(dataTrain, v = 10)
titanicFolds

degree_grid <- grid_regular(degree(range = c(1,10)), levels = 10)
degree_grid

```

```{r}
# tune_res <- tune_grid(
#   object = poly_tuned_wf,
#   resamples = titanicFolds,
#   grid = degree_grid,
#   control = control_grid(verbose = TRUE)
# )
```

### Question 3

In your own words, explain what we are doing in Question 2. What is *k*-fold cross-validation? Why should we use it, rather than simply fitting and testing models on the entire training set? If we **did** use the entire training set, what resampling method would that be?


**In question 2, we are taking the training data and dividing it into 10 groups. Then for each group, we train a model on the remainder of the data, and use the group as testing data. In this way we train 10 different models on various subsets of the same dataset. We can then test the effectiveness of each model and select that which the most effective. We use k folds cross validation in order to find a model that have a smaller bias. Using a simple test/train split method may result in a biased model, if the data happens to be split unevenly. If we did use the entire training dataset, the resampling method would be that of simple train/test split validation**

### Question 4

Set up workflows for 3 models:

1. A logistic regression with the `glm` engine;
2. A linear discriminant analysis with the `MASS` engine;
3. A quadratic discriminant analysis with the `MASS` engine.

How many models, total, across all folds, will you be fitting to the data? To answer, think about how many folds there are, and how many models you'll fit to each fold.

There are 10 folds and 3 models, so across all folds, we fit 30 models to the data.

```{r}

logReg <- logistic_reg() %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  set_engine("glm")

logWkflw <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(logReg) %>%
  add_recipe(titanicRecipe)



ldaMod <- discrim_linear() %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  set_engine("MASS")

ldaWkflw <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(ldaMod) %>%
  add_recipe(titanicRecipe)
  


qdaMod <- discrim_quad() %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  set_engine("MASS")

qdaWkflw <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(qdaMod) %>%
  add_recipe(titanicRecipe)
  
```

### Question 5

Fit each of the models created in Question 4 to the folded data.

**IMPORTANT:** *Some models may take a while to run – anywhere from 3 to 10 minutes. You should NOT re-run these models each time you knit. Instead, run them once, using an R script, and store your results; look into the use of [loading and saving](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/04/load-save-and-rda-files/). You should still include the code to run them when you knit, but set `eval = FALSE` in the code chunks.*

```{r}

# log_fit <- fit(logWkflw, dataTrain)
# lda_fit <- fit(ldaWkflw, dataTrain)
# qda_fit <- fit(qdaWkflw, dataTrain)



tune_log_res <- tune_grid(
  object = logWkflw,
  resamples = titanicFolds,
  grid = degree_grid,
  control = control_grid(verbose = TRUE)
)


tune_lda_res <- tune_grid(
  object = ldaWkflw,
  resamples = titanicFolds,
  grid = degree_grid,
  control = control_grid(verbose = TRUE)
)


tune_qda_res <- tune_grid(
  object = qdaWkflw,
  resamples = titanicFolds,
  grid = degree_grid,
  control = control_grid(verbose = TRUE)
)
```

### Question 6

Use `collect_metrics()` to print the mean and standard errors of the performance metric *accuracy* across all folds for each of the four models.

Decide which of the 3 fitted models has performed the best. Explain why. *(Note: You should consider both the mean accuracy and its standard error.)*


The logistic regression model was the most accurate. The mean accuracy was at least 2 percentage points higher than the other two models that were fit.
```{r}
# collect_metrics(log_fit)
# 
# collect_metrics(lda_fit)
# 
# collect_metrics(qda_fit)

# mean accuracies
logMetric <- collect_metrics(tune_log_res)
# 0.7964
logMetric$mean[1] - logMetric$std_err[1]
logMetric$mean[1] + logMetric$std_err[1]

ldaMetric <- collect_metrics(tune_lda_res)
# 0.7768
ldaMetric$mean[1] - ldaMetric$std_err[1]
ldaMetric$mean[1] + ldaMetric$std_err[1]

qdaMetric <- collect_metrics(tune_qda_res)
# 0.7584
qdaMetric$mean[1] - qdaMetric$std_err[1]
qdaMetric$mean[1] + qdaMetric$std_err[1]



```

### Question 7

Now that you’ve chosen a model, fit your chosen model to the entire training dataset (not to the folds).


```{r}

log_fit <- fit(logWkflw, data = dataTrain)

```

### Question 8

Finally, with your fitted model, use `predict()`, `bind_cols()`, and `accuracy()` to assess your model’s performance on the testing data!

Compare your model’s testing accuracy to its average accuracy across folds. Describe what you see.




The logistic regression model's testing accuracy is 85%, while the models average accuracy across folds is 79.6%.

```{r}

predict(log_fit, new_data = dataTest, type = "prob")

log_acc <- augment(log_fit, new_data = dataTest) %>%
  accuracy(truth = survived, estimate = .pred_class)

log_acc

# augment(final_fit, new_data = Auto_test) %>%
#   rmse(truth = mpg, estimate = .pred)


```

## Required for 231 Students

Consider the following intercept-only model, with $\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$:

$$
Y=\beta+\epsilon
$$

where $\beta$ is the parameter that we want to estimate. Suppose that we have $n$ observations of the response, i.e. $y_{1}, ..., y_{n}$, with uncorrelated errors.

### Question 9

Derive the least-squares estimate of $\beta$.


$$E[Y] = E[\beta + \epsilon] = E[\beta] + E[\epsilon] = E[\beta] + 0$$
$$\implies E[\beta] = E[Y] = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n y_i = \hat\beta$$


### Question 10

Suppose that we perform leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Recall that, in LOOCV, we divide the data into $n$ folds. What is the covariance between $\hat{\beta}^{(1)}$, or the least-squares estimator of $\beta$ that we obtain by taking the first fold as a training set, and $\hat{\beta}^{(2)}$, the least-squares estimator of $\beta$ that we obtain by taking the second fold as a training set?
